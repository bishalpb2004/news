                android:text="In a landmark achievement for India's G20 presidency, the (AU) got a
permanent seat at the G20 high table with PM Narendra Modi announcing it in his
opening remarks at the leaders’ summit. Foreign minister S Jaishankar escorted AU chair
and Comoros President Azali Assoumani to his seat after Modi brought the ceremonial
gavel down to invite AU to the premier forum for global economic cooperation.
PM Modi also embraced Assoumani before guiding him to his seat. Amid the gloom
of Ukraine war, and its restraining effects on India's G20 presidency, PM Modi had written
to all G20 leaders in June seeking a permanent membership for the 55-member
continental group which is home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world
and has a combined GDP of $ 2.4 trillion.
It was in the spirit of 'Sabka Saath' that India proposed permanent membership for them African Union in the G20. I believe that we all agree on this proposal, said PM Modi, as
he invited the AU chair.Foreign minister S Jaishankar later said it was a matter of particular satisfaction that AU
had become a member of G20 under India’s presidency. It’s in line with our priority to
address the concerns of the Global South, he said.As a resource-rich country with 1.3 billion people and youthful demographic, Africa has been keen to play a more significant role in international affairs. The AU is the second
regional group, after EU, to join G20. Only South Africa was a member of G20 so far.
While a formal proposal from AU for membership came only last year, African countries
had been advocating for G20 inclusion for the past 7 years.
According to Indian authorities, Modi himself led from the front for AU membership as he
believed this would be a step towards a 'just, fair, more inclusive and representative
global architecture and governance'.
Prime Minister is a strong believer in having a greater Voice of the Global South
countries on international platforms, particularly African countries. As part of India's G20
presidency, he has particularly focused on incorporating the priorities of African countries
in the G20 agenda, an Indian official had said earlier.
For India, which has been expanding its presence in Africa, the AU membership is
important also to show to the world that its focus on the Global South in G20 was not
just empty talk. AU’s inclusion was one of the rare issues that major powers like the US,
Russia and also China, which is a major lender and trading partner of Africa, agreed on."
